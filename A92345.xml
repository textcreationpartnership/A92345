            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FOraſmuch as for ſome time immediately after a tumultuous diſorder, all the diſcourſes thereof are uſually confuſed: It is neceſſary (if I may ſo ſpeak) to let the news reſt a little, that ſo it may have time to purifie it ſelf; and ſeeing it is not eaſie, in the heat of an accident newly happened, that the firſt relations ſhould be moſt true in all their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; it is from the ſeconds that we muſt draw the certain diſcoveries; the knowledge of which truth having obliged the Duke of <hi>Crequin,</hi> Ambaſſadour extraordinary for the King of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> to make careful inquiſition, in what manner all things paſſed in that Enterpriſe that was there acted; the roll paſt againſt him and the Embaſſadrix his Wife:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150217:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 57 -->after an exact examination of all that hath been ſaid thereof, by thoſe of each party, two things have been obſerved; one, that many particulars of ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment happened ſomewhat different to what was firſt written, which is very ordinary in ſuch ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters; the other, that by many circumſtances the buſineſs was yet more enormous then was at firſt adviſed, which is a thing unuſual; the firſt rumour for the moſt part heightning and aggravating things above what they really are: to the end therefore that you may not want the very exactneſs in a buſineſs of this nature, it is thought fit to write this ſecond rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby the Reader, without doubt, will be aſtoniſhed to ſee that in a City where the Spirit of peace ſhould rejoyce, there hath been done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the inviolable ſecurity of the publick faith, and right of Nations, an action ſo unheard of, that endeavours have been to aſſaſſinate in <hi>Rome</hi> perſons whoſe quality is owned for ſacred even in <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> it ſelf; and that in the place where the head of the Church reſides, there hath been committed againſt the eldeſt Son of the Church, in the perſon of his Ambaſſadour, an attempt whereof there hath not been any example amongſt the very Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> the twentieth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> about ſix of the clock at night, four men, which yet are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known whether they were French men or not, and four Souldiers <hi>Corſes,</hi> having quarrelled together at the end of the Bridge called <hi>Pente ſepte,</hi> and having drawn their Swords, were preſently parted
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150217:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 57 -->by a Frenchman, who came by, and cauſed them to put up their Swords into their ſheaths. In this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture they went on upon the Bridge, where being about the middle of the Bridge, there came to them eight or ten other Souldiers, who joyning with the four firſt, fell upon the five pretended Frenchmen, who preſently putting themſelves on their defence, forced their paſſage over the Bridge in deſpight of the Souldiers, and withdrew themſelves hard by the Ambaſſadours ſtables. Some of the Ambaſſadours houſhold Servants, with ſome of the Grooms, going out at the noiſe, and ſeeing people purſued with drawn Swords, beat back the Souldiers; but a great number coming, the Ambaſſadours people were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven back with musket-ſhot, even within the gate of the Pallace <hi>Farneſe,</hi> where he dwelt. There was hardly then ſix perſons in the houſe, the moſt part of his Gentlemen being gone abroad to walk, or to Duke <hi>Ceſarini</hi>'s, who had invited them to ſupper; the Ambaſſadrix being gone to her devotion at St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and the Ambaſſadour alſo gone forth to ſee the Princeſs <hi>Borgheſe:</hi> Returning from whom, having taken leave of thoſe that accompanied him, he came back with a very ſmall train to his houſe, and went in on one ſide juſt at the ſame time as the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had beaten in his men on the other: As ſoon as he underſtood what paſt, he ſent two or three Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to cauſe them to withdraw; and they were no ſooner out for this purpoſe, but ſeven or eight bullets were ſhot at them; then, as if the ſignal had been given, all the retainers to the Pallace were ſeized on by the <hi>Corſes,</hi> who came thither with drums beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150217:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 58 -->and placed thereabouts in a moment eight or ten Courts of guard: The Ambaſſadour at the news thereof went up into a Balcony, and preſently they diſcharged many ſhots at him, whereof one killed an Italian under the windows of the Pallace; and after, for the ſpace of an hour and an half, they cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to ſhoot from all parts, whereof there are yet many marks on all ſides of the Chambers. In the mean time, in all other parts of the City, the Souldiers likewiſe put themſelves in Armes, crying that the Horſe ſhould advance to charge the French, amongſt whom three Gentlemen of the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, having been ſet upon near the Pallace that is called <hi>d'Eſpagne,</hi> half a league from thence, had been killed, if they had not ſaved themſelves at the Cardinals of <hi>Arragon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it was not the Souldiers only that took Armes; the Sbirres or Sergeants themſelves, to ſhew that all was done by expreſs order, armed themſelves alſo; and they which never ſhot on any occaſion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, wounded in the place <hi>Navone,</hi> a Gentleman of the Ambaſſadours with a Musket in the belly; one of his Lacquies on the other ſide received a ſhot in his body, whereof he is dead; and his Pallace remained beſet near three houres, without permitting any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſtir. The Ambaſſadrix her ſelf coming from Church, and being yet far off from her houſe, was ſtopt near Saint <hi>Charles de Getinari;</hi> but it is too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to ſay ſhe was ſtopt, ſeeing they endeavoured to kill her; the Souldiers that kept that poſt, having let paſſe the Coach of her Gentlemen, diſcharged ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150217:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 58 -->ſhot at hers, killed a Page in the boot by her an Italian, who a little before believing himſelf ſafe by the Coach of the Ambaſſadrix of <hi>France,</hi> had advanced himſelf; out of curioſity to ſee her, was woundedd beſides another of her Lacquies with a Croſſe-bow ſhot upon the head. It is ſo amazing a deed, that one could not have dreamt that there ſhould have been thoughts of ſuch an attempt on the perſon of an Ambaſſadour and his Lady; one is even loth to ſpeak it; but who can be ſilent, when on the one ſide we ſee her aſſaſſinated in this manner; and on the other, it is evident, that they ſhot at him, and that it is ſince ſaid, there were ſeventeen <hi>Conſes</hi> who had order to kill him! The Ambaſſadrix was conſtrained to divert half dead, and to ſave her ſelf at the Cardinal <hi>d' Eſtes,</hi> where ſeeing there was no ſafety for her to go forth, ſhe ſtayed a long time, and till ſhe was reduced to capitulate with the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants to let her paſſe. The Cardinal conducted her home himſelf, marching in his Chair juſt before her Coach.</p>
            <p>Behold here a true Narration of the thing as it paſſed, whereof the Ambaſſadours that were at <hi>Rome,</hi> and all Perſons of honour unintereſſed, can freely bear witneſs. Notwithſtanding after this offence done to a King in the Perſon of his Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour, which cannot be expiated but by very great ſatisfactions, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> hath uſed no endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make any; yea ſhe endeavoureth preſently to palliate the buſineſs by Artifices and Diſguiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;

               <!-- PDF PAGE 59 -->and publickly in a little time ſhe will take the confidence to go further, and to ſeek Reaſons to juſtifie it; but his Majeſty hath this advantage, that if they do not give him the ſatisfaction which is due to him, and which he may expect, he is in a capacity to right himſelf.</p>
